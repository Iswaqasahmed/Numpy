# Numpy ? :
`NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is one of the most important foundational packages
for numerical computing in Python.`
### Merits of Numpy's 
• ndarray, an efficient multidimensional array providing fast array-oriented arithmetic
operations and flexible broadcasting capabilities.
• Mathematical functions for fast operations on entire arrays of data without having
to write loops.
• Tools for reading/writing array data to disk and working with memory-mapped
files.
• Linear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transform capabilities.
• A C API for connecting NumPy with libraries written in C, C++, or FORTRAN


# Array ?
In computer science, an array data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.
